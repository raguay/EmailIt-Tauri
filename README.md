# EmailIt

A simple program for sending emails quickly through the Script Server. This version is mostly an exercise to learn Tauri and Rust.

To build, you run:

```sh
npm run build
cargo tauri build
```

The `npm` build creates the frontend Svelte project. The `cargo` builds the actual rust application that runs the program. 

This requires the Script Server for the backend logic currently. I've not gotten far enough to have it all itegrated. Still learning...
